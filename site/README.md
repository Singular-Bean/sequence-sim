# Sequence Sim React Frontend

This is the frontend for Sequence Sim using React and Vite.

To run the frontend on Linux or Windows, ensure nodejs and pnpm are installed, and run:

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

When running locally, the app will use http://localhost:7860 for the backend, otherwise it will use the backend deployed to Hugging Face Spaces. See the [backend README](../backend/README.md) for more details.
